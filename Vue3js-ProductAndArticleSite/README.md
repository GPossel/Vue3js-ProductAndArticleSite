Hi!
This project contains the front-end app using Vue.js components, bootstrap and CSS.
The project added a drag and drop for the uploading and updating of pictures.
The project accepts either URL refs to pictures or the .jpeg or .png gets saved on the PHP side. (folder: public/uploads)
The drag and drop functionality could not exist without the writer: https://www.npmjs.com/~maffeis
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-picture-input?activeTab=readme all I had to do was to update the breaking changes for Vue 3 js.
Big thank you to https://www.npmjs.com/~maffeis for creating the template.
